## About This Repo

This repo was built to present a public proposal for **NGELARAS ROSO**—a physical cultural hub dedicated to preserving Indonesian traditions and heritage. The web app documents the vision, shares the story, and demonstrates a Web3-enabled approach to engage wider audiences.

### Story

- NGELARAS ROSO was established as a place for cultural activities and preservation, but declining public awareness left it increasingly neglected.
- We collaborated with the owner to translate the mission into a concrete proposal, and shipped it as a published web app.
- A small miscommunication between the owner and the broader team later caused the project to pause after the site was delivered.

### Blockchain

- NFTs were prototyped on **Base Sepolia** and designed to ship on **Base**.
- Architecture remains compatible with migration to any **EVM-compatible** chain when needed.

### Technology

- Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- thirdweb (EVM wallet + contract integrations)
- Vercel deployment

### How we build (quality + workflow)

- We ship production-safe changes and keep the app buildable on Node / Vercel.
- We run controlled dependency upgrades and always verify with audit/lint/build.
- We keep the “Live Artefact App” policy intact: user-facing UX stays frozen unless a versioned successor is intentionally created.

## Maintenance by Prof. NOTA Evergreen Standard

This repo is a **Live Artefact App**: the user-facing UX is intentionally frozen
("MINT CLOSED", no wallet prompts), while the codebase remains buildable and
production-safe on Vercel.

### Runtime

- Node: **24.x** (local + Vercel)
- Package manager: **Yarn 4.12.0** (lockfile: `yarn.lock`)
- `@types/node`: **24.10.7** (pinned to match Node 24; 25.x intentionally deferred)
- Deploy target: **Vercel**

### Build System

- Next.js **16.1.4** (Turbopack)

### Monthly Safe Updates (recommended)

Monthly is **monitor + verify**, not modernization.

1. Check what’s outdated (report only):

   - `yarn outdated`

2. Security report (report only unless explicitly approved):

   - `yarn npm audit --severity moderate`

3. Verify build reproducibility:

   - `yarn lint`
   - `yarn build`

4. Verify production sanity:

   - Confirm "MINT CLOSED"
   - Confirm no wallet prompts / connect flows
   - Confirm no critical console errors

### Major Updates (quarterly / scheduled)

Major upgrades must be done **one at a time**, with a dedicated PR and full testing.
Artefact UX must remain unchanged.

Examples:

- React major version upgrade
- Web3 stack upgrade (e.g., web3 v1 → v4)
- Toolchain changes
- Node major policy change

### Artefact UX Policy (Frozen)

- Minting must remain **disabled**
- Wallet connect must remain **disabled**
- Any functional change requires a versioned successor (new tag/release)
